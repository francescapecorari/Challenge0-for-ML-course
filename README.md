# Challenge0-for-ML-course
Challenge 0 for the "Introduzione al machine learning" course at the university of Trieste.

The challenge focuses on the use of the pandas package for data cleaning, One-Hot Encoding and supervised learning techniques.

Techniques used:
-  Logistic Regression
-  Gradient descent
-  Ridge Logistic Regression
-  Ridge Gradient Descent
-  Lasso Logistic Regression
-  Lasso Gradient Descent
-  Elastic Nets Logistic Regression
-  Elastic Nets Gradient Descent

In the end a model assessment is performed and a ROC curve is plotted.

The code is in python and written in a Notebook without using pre-made functions for the ML techniques.
